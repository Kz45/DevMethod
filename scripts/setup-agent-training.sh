## 🎯 Training Files Generated

### Agent PRPs (Role-Specific Instructions)
- \`agent-prps/dev-${TECH_STACK}-${PROJECT_NAME}.md\` - DEV Agent instructions
- \`agent-prps/architect-${TECH_STACK}-${PROJECT_NAME}.md\` - ARCHITECT Agent instructions
- \`agent-prps/qa-${TECH_STACK}-${PROJECT_NAME}.md\` - QA Agent instructions
- \`agent-prps/pm-${TECH_STACK}-${PROJECT_NAME}.md\` - PM Agent instructions

### Technical Knowledge Files
- \`agent-knowledge/dev-${TECH_STACK}-knowledge.md\` - Technical patterns and practices
- \`agent-knowledge/architect-${TECH_STACK}-knowledge.md\` - Architecture patterns
- \`agent-knowledge/qa-${TECH_STACK}-knowledge.md\` - Testing strategies

## 🚀 How to Use These Files

### Step 1: Train Each Agent
For each agent, load both files:
1. Their specific PRP file (role instructions)
2. Their technical knowledge file (if applicable)

### Step 2: Agent Training Prompt
\`\`\`
You are [AGENT_NAME] for the $PROJECT_NAME project.

1. First, read this role-specific PRP completely:
[Paste content from agent-prps/[agent]-${TECH_STACK}-${PROJECT_NAME}.md]

2. Then, load this technical knowledge:
[Paste content from agent-knowledge/[agent]-${TECH_STACK}-knowledge.md]

3. Confirm understanding by saying "Ready to work on $PROJECT_NAME"

From now on, ONLY follow these specific instructions. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification instead of assuming.
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Validate Agent Understanding
Each agent should confirm they understand:
- Their specific role and responsibilities
- The technical patterns to follow
- The validation criteria for their work
- What to do when they're uncertain

## 🔍 Quality Checkpoints

Before starting development, ensure:
- [ ] All agent PRPs have been reviewed and approved
- [ ] Technical knowledge files match your actual tech stack
- [ ] Agents understand their specific responsibilities
- [ ] Communication protocols between agents are clear

## 📈 Success Metrics

With properly trained agents, you should see:
- Faster development velocity
- Higher code quality
- Fewer back-and-forth clarifications
- Better adherence to standards
- More predictable outcomes

## 🔄 Iteration and Improvement

After each project phase:
1. Gather feedback from agent performance
2. Update PRP files with lessons learned
3. Refine technical knowledge based on discoveries
4. Improve training prompts for next iteration

**Next Step**: Use these files to train your agents and begin development with DevMethod!
