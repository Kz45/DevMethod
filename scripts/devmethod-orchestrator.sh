# ARCHITECT Agent Instructions - Parallel Session

## Your Parallel Task
Design the system architecture for: $TASK_DESCRIPTION

## Files You Own (No Conflicts)
- docs/architecture/ (all files)
- Any architecture documentation

## Dependencies
- Wait for: None (can start immediately)
- Blocks: DEV agent (they need your architecture)

## Deliverables
1. System architecture document
2. Database design
3. API architecture
4. Security considerations

## Coordination
- Notify when complete: Update status in orchestration/status/architect_status.json
- Communication: Use orchestration/communication/ for messages to other agents

## Estimated Time: 45 minutes
## Status Updates: Every 15 minutes

Begin when ready - you have the green light for parallel work!
