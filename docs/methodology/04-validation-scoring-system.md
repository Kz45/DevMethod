# DevMethod: Validation & Scoring System

## 🎯 Arquitectura Multi-Capa de Validación

DevMethod integra sistemas de validación de BMAD, WIRASM-PRPS y Cole Medin en un framework unificado de 4 capas sin redundancia.

### Filosofía de Validación
> **"Fail fast, fail cheap, succeed with confidence"**

- **Detect early**: Problems found early cost less to fix
- **Validate continuously**: Each step validates previous steps  
- **Score objectively**: Measurable criteria eliminate guesswork
- **Automate relentlessly**: Human review for decisions, automation for checks

## 📊 Sistema de Scoring Unificado

Specificity_Ratio:
  calculation: Specific_Statements / Generic_Statements  
  target: > 2.0 (2x more specific than generic)
  
Actionability_Score:
  calculation: Actionable_Items / Total_Items
  target: > 0.8 (80% of items should be actionable)
  
Completeness_Index:
  calculation: Filled_Fields / Required_Fields
  target: 1.0 (100% of required fields completed)
```

    - 180-189 points = 8/10
    - 170-179 points = 6/10
    - <170 points = 4/10 or less
    
  Research_Depth: 30% weight
    - Multi-source research completed = 10/10
    - Single-source research = 7/10
    - Limited research = 5/10
